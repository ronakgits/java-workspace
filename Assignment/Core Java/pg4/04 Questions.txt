	We have to calculate the percentage of marks 
	
	obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) 
	
	by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. 
	
	Create an abstract class 'Marks' 
	with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. 
	
	It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B'
	
	each having a method with the same name 
	which returns the percentage of the students. 
	
	The constructor of student A 
	takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters 
	and 
	the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. 
	
	Create an object for 
	each of the two classes 
	and 
	print the percentage of marks for both the students.

	Write a program to print the factorial of a number 
	
	by defining a method named 'Factorial'. 
	
	Factorial of any number n is represented by n! 
	And 
	is equal to 1*2*3*. *(n-1) *n. 
	
	E.g.:
	4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
	3! = 3*2*1 = 6
	2! = 2*1 = 2
	Also, 1! = 1
	0! = 0

	We have to calculate 
	the area of 
	a Rectangle, a Square and a Circle. 
	
	Create an abstract class 'Shape' 
	
	with three abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea' 
	taking two parameters, 
	'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. 
	
	The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, 
	that of 'SquareArea' is its side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. 
	
	Now create another class 'Area' 
	
	containing all the three methods 
	
	'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' 
	
	for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. 
	
	Create an object of class 'Area' 
	and 
	call all the three methods.

 	Write a program which will ask 
	the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). 
	
	Define a method 
	that will display grades 
	according to the marks entered as below:

	Marks 	 Grade
	91-100	 AA
	81-90	 AB
	71-80	 BB
	61-70	 BC
	51-60	 CD
	41-50	 DD
	40 		 Fail
