	Create a class named 'Shape' 
	with a method to print "This is this is shape". 
	
	Then create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' 
	
	inheriting the Shape class, 
	both having a method 
	
	to print "This is rectangular shape" 
	and 
	"This is circular shape" respectively. 
	
	Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' 
	
	having a method 
	to print "Square is a rectangle". 
	
	Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class 
	
	by the object of 'Square' class.
